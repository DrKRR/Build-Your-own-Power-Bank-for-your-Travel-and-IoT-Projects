# Build-Your-own-Power-Bank-for-your-Travel-and-IoT-Projects
This Project explains how to build a cost-effective power bank for mobile phones during travel and for powering up the IoT Projects as DIY (Do It Yourself).
On highways, there is every likelyhood that mobile towers are built in such a way that continuous signals are available for the mobile. 
But during normal road and train journies, our travel passes through ups,downs,curvatures and amid big hills. During these times, no mobile signals will be there or the signals will be very feeble. Thus, we travel constantly in and out of a tower’s range and into the next one . The device (mobile or any electronic device that uses data) ping each tower when entering and leaving it’s range. Signal searching becomes more aggressive when signals from other cell towers (not registered with the SIM card inside the mobile) are within the range of the mobile. The radio inside the device (transmitter and receiver section on the mobile), uses more power during such signal fluctuations that results in more power usage which leads to battery drain.
