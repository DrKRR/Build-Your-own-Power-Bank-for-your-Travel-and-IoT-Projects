# Build-Your-own-Power-Bank-for-your-Travel-and-IoT-Projects
The Project explains how to build a cost-effective Power bank for mobile phones during travel and for powering up the IoT Projects as DIY (Do It Yourself).
On highways, there is every likelyhood that mobile towers are built in such a way that continuous signals are available for the mobile. 
But during normal road and train journies, our travel passes through ups,downs,curvatures and amid big hills. During these times, no mobile signals will be there or the signals will be very feeble.
