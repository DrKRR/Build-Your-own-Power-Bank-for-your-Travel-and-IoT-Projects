# Build-Your-own-Power-Bank-for-your-Travel-and-IoT-Projects
This Project explains how to build a cost-effective power bank for mobile phones during travel and for powering up the IoT Projects as **DIY** (Do It Yourself).

On highways, there is every likelyhood that mobile towers are built in such a way that continuous signals are available for the mobile data and hence battery will last for more time. But during normal road and train journies, our travel passes through ups,downs,curvatures and amidst big hills. During these times, no mobile signals will be there or the signals will be very feeble. Thus, we travel constantly in and out of a tower’s range and into the next one . The device (mobile or any electronic device that uses data) ping each tower when entering and leaving it’s range. Signal searching becomes more aggressive when signals from other cell towers (not registered with the SIM card inside the mobile) are within the range of the mobile. The radio inside the device (transmitter and receiver section on the mobile), uses more power during such signal fluctuations to maintain the network level, that results in more power usage which leads to battery drain. Worst case being, the mobile switches off before reaching the destination point. Carrying a power bank(s) in such scenarios, will avoid frustration, especially, when there are limited charging points. </br>

Readymade power banks are available on the market. But, they are not only costly but also the troubleshooting is a difficult task. In the light of this fact, I present DIY power bank which is cost-effective and also easy to replace when there is a problem with the battery or
charging electronics. It works well during travel and also can be used for testing embedded and IoT projects.
Power bank mainly consists of three parts:
* Lithium-ion or Lithium-polymer battery
* Battery charging electronic circuit
* Case to hold both the above
