# Build-Your-own-Power-Bank-for-your-Travel-and-IoT-Projects
This Project explains how to build a cost-effective power bank for mobile phones during travel and for powering up the IoT Projects as **DIY** (Do It Yourself).

On highways, there is every likelyhood that mobile towers are built in such a way that continuous signals are available for the mobile data and hence battery will last for more time. But during normal road and train journies, our travel passes through ups, downs, curvatures and amidst big hills. During these times, no mobile signals will be available or the signals will be very feeble. Thus, we travel constantly in and out of a tower’s range and into the next one . The device (mobile or any electronic device that uses data) ping each tower when entering and leaving it’s range. Signal searching becomes more aggressive when signals from other cell towers (not registered with the SIM card inside the mobile) are within the range of the mobile. The radio inside the device (transmitter and receiver section on the mobile), uses more power during such signal fluctuations to maintain the network level, that results in more power usage which leads to battery drain. Worst case being, the mobile switches off before reaching the destination point. Carrying a power bank(s) in such scenarios will avoid frustration, especially, when there are limited charging points. </br>

Readymade power banks are available on the market. But, they are not only costly but also the troubleshooting is a difficult task. In the light of this fact, I present DIY power bank which is cost-effective and also easy to replace when there is a problem with the battery or
charging electronics. It works well during travel and also can be used for testing embedded and IoT projects.
## MATERIALS AND METHOD ##
Power bank mainly consists of three parts:
* Lithium-ion or Lithium-polymer battery
* Battery charging electronic circuit
* Case to hold both the above
### BATTERY ###
In this explanation I concentrate on Lithium-ion batteries, due to its popularity. In fact, the Nobel Prize in *Chemistry* for the year 2019 is being shared by three scientists for their invention: *"Development of Lithium-ion Batteries"*

Certain advantages of Li-ion batteries include:
* lighter and more compact compared Lead-acid batteries still found in cars
* rechargeable, unlike disposable zinc and alkaline batteries used in medical-electronic devices and toys
* unlike Nickel-Cadmium rechargeable batteries that contains toxic Cd, Li-ion batteries doesn't contain toxic metal
* Li-ion battery doesn't have "memory effect", which is prevalant in Ni-Cd cells
* Li-ion cells are availble in portable sizes and shapes: cylindrical and rectangular 
  
Following are the images of Li-ion batteries used in power banks, laptops, mobile phones etc.

In the above, Li-ion batteries shown in (a) and (b) are used in mobile phones, tablets while that are used in power banks and laptops is shown in (c).
Li-ion batteries used in power banks and laptop's power supplies, and general power supplies are numbered as 18650 with 3.7V and current ratings is shown below:

The cross-sectional views of both type of batteries are shown below. Working of the battery is out of the scope this presentation.

### ELECTRONIC CHARGING CIRCUIT ###

Charging of LI-ion 18650 battery can be accomplished by different methods. Due to the developments in VLSI technology, many charging circuits are coming in the form of ICs. These ICs in conjunction with PCB mountable miniature L,C,R components will be used as battery chargers.
